## About
Yonder Dynamics is one of UCSD's interdisciplinary robotics organizations for undergraduates, with its primary focus on constructing an autonomous rover for terrestrial exploration. We compete annually in the University Rover Challenge, with Procyon and conduct biochemical and microbiological tests for signs of life. Yonder's primary purpose is to empower undergraduates to work in robotics, space, and related fields, regardless of their age and major, or other circumstances. We believe in teaching our members how to learn on the job and function well as part of a team, and to dare to achieve mighty things.

The University Rover Challenge (URC) is the world's premier international robotics competition for college students, hosted by The Mars Society.  Held annually in the desert of southern Utah in the United States, URC challenges student teams to design and build the next generation of Mars rovers that will one day work alongside astronauts exploring the Red Planet.
